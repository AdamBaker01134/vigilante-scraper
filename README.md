# vigilante-scraper
After getting a bike stolen, you begin having delusions about the thief being foolish enough to place your item online for sale on websites
like Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace, and other vendors. You begin to check these websites daily for any signs of your lost item but no luck.
This begins to get tedious. You stop being as vigilant... and that's when the thief makes their move! You have lost...
 
But no more! With VigilanteScraper you can search multiple marketplace websites with the click of a button! Ye better be afraid, thievers!
